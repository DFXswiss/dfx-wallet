# Maestro E2E Tests

End-to-end UI tests for DFX Wallet using [Maestro](https://maestro.mobile.dev/). Flows live in `.maestro/` as YAML.

## Why Maestro

- Works with Expo dev-client and release builds (no separate test instrumentation needed)
- YAML flows — low barrier to add coverage
- Single flow runs against both iOS Simulator and Android Emulator
- Self-hosted in GitHub Actions, no external service dependency

## Prerequisites

The wallet ships native modules that are not Expo Go compatible (`react-native-ble-plx`, `react-native-mmkv`, `react-native-nitro-modules`, `bitbox-api`, `@tetherto/wdk-react-native-provider`). Maestro therefore requires an installed dev-client or release build, never Expo Go.

- Maestro CLI: `brew tap mobile-dev-inc/tap && brew install maestro` (or `curl -Ls https://get.maestro.mobile.dev | bash`)
- iOS: Xcode 16+, an iOS Simulator (run `xcrun simctl list devices`), and Facebook IDB (`brew tap facebook/fb && brew install idb-companion`) — required by Maestro to drive the simulator
- Android: Android SDK with an emulator image (API 34+, x86_64)
- Built and installed app:
  - iOS: `npx expo run:ios --configuration Release`
  - Android: `npx expo run:android --variant release`

Disable Face ID / Touch ID enrollment in the iOS Simulator (`Features > Face ID > Enrolled` off) before running flows — biometric prompts will otherwise intercept the PIN screen during onboarding.

## Running Locally

Boot a simulator/emulator first, then:

```bash
# iOS Simulator (must be booted)
npm run e2e:maestro:ios

# Android Emulator (must be booted)
npm run e2e:maestro:android
```

Both scripts run every flow under `.maestro/`. To run a single flow:

```bash
maestro test .maestro/01-welcome.yaml
```

To debug interactively:

```bash
maestro studio
```

## Test Configuration

Flows target a Testnet build of the app. The relevant environment variables are read by `src/config/env.ts` and `src/config/chains.ts` and must be set at **build time** (not at Maestro runtime — they are baked into the JS bundle):

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_DFX_API_URL=...        # DFX API testnet endpoint
EXPO_PUBLIC_WDK_INDEXER_URL=...    # WDK indexer endpoint
EXPO_PUBLIC_ETH_RPC_URL=...        # ETH testnet RPC
# ... see src/config/chains.ts for the full list
```

Set these before `npx expo run:ios` / `npx expo run:android` so the resulting binary points at testnet infrastructure.

## testID Convention

Flows use stable `testID` selectors (`id:` in YAML) — text-based selectors are avoided so flows are i18n-proof. Convention:

```
<screen>-<element>
```

Examples:

- `welcome-screen` (container of the welcome screen)
- `welcome-create-wallet-button`
- `welcome-restore-toggle`
- `welcome-restore-seed-button`
- `pin-key-1` … `pin-key-9`, `pin-key-0`, `pin-key-del`
- `setup-pin-screen` / `setup-pin-confirm-screen` (same screen, two states)
- `dashboard-screen`
- `dashboard-action-send`

Container elements (the screen root) carry the `<screen>-screen` ID; interactive elements append a verb-noun (`-button`, `-toggle`, `-input`, `-checkbox`, `-key-N`).

## Flow Naming

```
<NN>-<area>-<scenario>.yaml
```

- `NN` = two-digit prefix; smoke flows start at `01-`, feature flows at `10-`
- `area` = onboarding, pin, send, receive, dashboard, kyc, hardware
- `scenario` = short kebab-case description

Current flows:

- `01-welcome.yaml` — smoke: app launches, welcome screen renders
- `10-onboarding-create.yaml` — full create-wallet onboarding through to dashboard
- `11-onboarding-restore.yaml` — restore-from-seed onboarding through to dashboard (uses `${TEST_MNEMONIC}` env var, default is the standard `test test … junk` BIP39 mnemonic)
- `12-pin-unlock.yaml` — onboard, cold-restart the app, exercise the wrong-PIN error path, then unlock with the correct PIN

## Limitations

- **Hardware Wallet flows**: Maestro cannot drive physical BitBox02 devices or BLE pairing dialogs. Hardware-wallet tests must run against the mock provider in `src/services/hardware-wallet/`.
- **Biometrics**: Face ID / Fingerprint prompts are scriptable on simulators (`xcrun simctl ... biometric` / `adb emu finger touch`) but require an explicit step in the flow.
- **Passkeys**: WebAuthn / Passkey ceremonies cannot be fully automated on simulators yet — gate passkey-dependent flows behind a feature flag for E2E builds.

## CI

`.github/workflows/maestro-e2e.yml` runs the full suite on iOS Simulator and Android Emulator in parallel.

Triggers:

- `pull_request` against `develop` — non-draft PRs only, skipped on doc-only changes (`paths-ignore: '**/*.md', 'docs/**'`). Marking a draft PR as ready-for-review fires the workflow.
- `workflow_dispatch` — manual run for any branch.

Concurrent runs on the same PR cancel each other (`concurrency: cancel-in-progress: true`), so rebases don't pile up runner time.

### Runners

Both jobs target self-hosted ephemeral macOS VMs. Each job claims a fresh VM cloned from a warm snapshot, runs to completion, and the VM is destroyed afterwards. Persistent caches (CocoaPods, Gradle, Android AVD, npm) are mounted into the VM from the host and survive between jobs.

Runner labels:

- iOS: `[self-hosted, macos, e2e-ios]`
- Android: `[self-hosted, macos, e2e-android]`

Approval gating is on for outside collaborators (Settings → Actions → "Require approval for all outside collaborators") so fork PRs can't trigger the runners without a maintainer signing off.

### Build-time configuration

- Public values (DFX API URL, WDK indexer URL, chain RPCs) live in the committed `.env.testnet` at the repo root. Edit that file when the testnet endpoints land.
- Only the WDK indexer API key is treated as a secret. Set it as a repo **secret** named `E2E_WDK_INDEXER_API_KEY` — the workflow injects it via `env:` so it overrides whatever's in `.env.testnet`.
- Both jobs do `cp .env.testnet .env` before the build so Expo's `EXPO_PUBLIC_*` baking sees the right values.

For local runs, do the same: `cp .env.testnet .env && npm run ios` (or `android`). Override the API key by adding a single line `EXPO_PUBLIC_WDK_INDEXER_API_KEY=...` to your `.env` after the copy.
